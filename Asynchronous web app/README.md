# Asynchronous Web App Development

This project is a simple web application that demonstrates asynchronous programming in JavaScript. It displays a list of items (fruits and vegetables) fetched asynchronously from a JSON file and allows users to drag and drop the items into different drop zones based on their categories.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
- `cascade.css`: CSS file for styling the web page.
- `code.js`: JavaScript file containing the logic for fetching data asynchronously and implementing drag-and-drop functionality.
- `data.json`: JSON file containing sample data for fruits and vegetables.
- `README.md`: This file providing information about the project.
- `License.txt` : It contains details about the license.

## Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   git clone <repository_url>

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   cd asynchronous-web-app

3. Open the index.html file in your web browser.
   
## Usage

Once the project is set up and the index.html file is opened in a web browser, the web page will display a list of items fetched asynchronously from the data.json file. Users can drag and drop the items into different drop zones labeled "Fruits" and "Vegetables" based on their categories.
